Example Code: 
> The following illustrates the main function similiar to C++. This code block shows Math (i.e adding, substracting, multiplying, dividing, and mod), instantiation of an Integer and an Array and how to have comments.
```
Integer main() {
    # This is a comment
    Integer variable = 1;
    Array<Integer> arr = [];

    variable = 2;
    variable = 2 + 2;
    variable = 2 - 2;
    variable = 2 * 2;
    variable = 2 / 2;
    variable = 2 % 2;

    return variable;
}
```
